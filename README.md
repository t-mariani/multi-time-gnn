# multi-time-gnn

Personal project to implement GNN (Graph neural network) for multivariates time series 

First version is based on :

### Things that we need to understand
What is the channel in the convolution layer? Not clear at all for me.


### Constants names

N: number of sensors
A: adjency matrix (represents the graph)
C: embedding dimension
